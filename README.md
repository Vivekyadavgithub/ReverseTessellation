# ReverseTessellation

Requirements to Build :
  Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
  Gpu that Supports Opengl 4.1 minimum
  
How to build:
  Clone the repo and run the .sln file.
  Visual studio shall open up switch to Debug x86(if not by default) instead of x64.
  I have added my vsuser file so it should be able to link glfw, glew and glm libraries as soon as you switch to x86 build.
